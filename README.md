## Hi there I'm Daniel Atom Malloy ðŸ‘‹

### Here is a little bit about me:
I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and my Masterâ€™s in Business Administration at High Point University in North Carolina. Although I completed my education in North Carolina, I currently reside in Florida. This has allowed me to connect with companies in my area, which ultimately led me to Palo Alto. As of February 18, 2025, I am proud to have achieved a full-time position at Palo Alto as a Tech Consultant.

I am excited for this opportunity and am committed to maintaining a healthy work-life balance that allows me to pursue my hobbies. One of my biggest passions is Warhammer, where I enjoy painting sculptures, like the one shown beside this text. I take pride in my artistry and look forward to completing my first army so I can start competing. Additionally, I am an avid fan of the Horus Heresy books and plan to finish all 64 volumes.

Thank you for stopping by my page! Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn below!
